          <h3>Configuration Space and Workspace</h3>
          <p>
            We are given a robot arm (Figure 25.14a in the text) with two joints
            that move independently, and both are capable of swinging a full 360
            degrees. It operates in a fixed sized box. It is mounted on a
            vertical base center of the bottom of the box. The segments of the
            arm are; the fixed base (black), a shoulder segment (blue), and an
            elbow segment (green).
          </p>
          <p>
            When the joints move they alter the positions of the arm segments in
            a cartesian coordinate sytem. This is displayed in a
            <b>workspace</b> representation. Assuming the base segment is fixed,
            the robot's configuration can be described by a four-dimensional
            coordinate: \((x_e, y_e)\) for the location of the elbow relative to
            the environment and \((x_g, y_g)\) for the location of the gripper,
            or end of the elbow segment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all workspace coordinates are actually attainable (even without
            obstacles). For example in the default configuration the arm is
            stopped from goping beyond the floor of the box. When obstacles are
            added to workspace world, the arm has additional areas where it
            cannot reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            When planning motions for the robot it is easier to use a
            <b>configuration space</b> representation. In this representation
            the state space is continuous. We represent the state with two
            angles; elbow \(\varphi_e\), and shoulder \(\varphi_s\).
          </p>
          <p>
            This visualization allows you to add obstacles to the
            <b>workspace</b> representation, by simply clicking on a cell in the
            workspace (turning it dark gray). When you do the
            <b>configuration space</b> is updated with regions that the arm can
            not access. Black areas indicate that the arm is up against the
            boundaries of the containing box. Blue indicates that the shoulder
            segment is prevented from orienting itself at that angle
            (\(\varphi_s\)). Green indicates that the elbow segment of the arm
            is prevented from orienting itself at that angle (\(\varphi_e\)). 
            A small red cross indicates the current position of the robot gripper.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can manually position the two joints with the shoulder and elbow
            contols (click in the circle to orient the joint). You can also
            alter the lengths of the segments (including the base), by clicking
            on those controls.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can animate movement of the arm with the start and end buttons.
            This animation is not garanteed to reach all possible
            configurations. Depending on how the obstacles are arranged it may
            not be possible to the arm to get on either side of it. So initial
            positioning of the arm can significantly affect the ability of the
            animation to reach a given configuration.
