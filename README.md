# Configuration Space and Workspace Visualization

This simple JavaScript app provides an interactive visualization of the **configuration space** and the **workspace** view of a simple two-jointed robotic arm.  This visualiztion was 
inspired by the description found in Chapter 25 of the text *[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Third Edition)](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)*.  

This visualization was originaly created as an independent study option for an AI course (DCS909) at [Aspen University](http://www.aspen.edu).  It is hoped that this application will be accepted to accompany other visualizations and interactions for this textbook assembled at [aima-javascript](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-javascript).

The structure of this project and code is oriented to the aima-javascript guidelines.

You can try it out in your own browser here: [Configuration Spaces and Workspaces](https://jconallen.github.io/configuration-and-workspace/).
